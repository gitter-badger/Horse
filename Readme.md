# The Rules to Horse

Horse is a [Bid Euchre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bid_Euchre) variant, having some similarities to [500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/500_(card_game))

* similar to Euchre (Bauers if there is trump)
* deck has cards 9 and up, no jokers
* 24 cards with 4 players (i.e. 6 cards per player)

## Bidding
* bid for # of tricks (up to 6)
* bid winner declares trump (or that there is no trump) after winning the bid
* special bid: "Horse" (== 6, going alone)
	* 6 tricks with a trump (i.e. cannot be no-trump, which is just "6")
	* opponents can double
		* this means that *they* are bidding Horse
		* if the double stands, opponents become the bid winners
	* original bidding team can redouble
		* doubling, redoubling is *only* for "Horse" bids
	* bidder asks partner for up to 6 cards from their hand
	* bidder chooses up to 6 losers to drop from their hand before getting new cards
	* bidder hands discarded cards to partner, who puts them face-down
	* partner hands bidder the new cards
	* bidder plays alone against the two opponents
	* the person to the left of the declarer leads off the first trick

## Scoring
### Making your bid
* 1 point per trick won
* a bid of 6 (*not* Horse - e.g. 6 no-trump) = 6 points
* special scoring only for "Horse" bids:
	* 2 points per trick = 12 points if successful
	* if doubled: 24 points
	* if redoubled: 48 points

### Losing your bid
* opponents gain 1 point per trick they take
	* if this pushes their score over 50 they do _not_ win the game
	* only a positive score from making a bid wins the game
* bidder gets -1 point per trick bid
	* -2 point per trick if Horse was bid = -12
	* -4 point per trick if Horse was redoubled = -48

## Victory conditions
1. scoring 50 or more by winning a bid
	* scoring 50 or more by foiling a bid will not win
1. opponents go below -24

## Bidding Conventions
* If you have only 1 jack and bad cards: pass
* 2 jacks: bid 2 â€” if partner has a jack they should bid Horse
* A bid of 3 can be a defensive bid to simply prevent a 2 bid by opponents
